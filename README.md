# CNN-Introduction
Included is a presentation that introduces deep learning, convolutions, and convolutional neural networks. In addition, there are three Google Colab notebooks that demonstrate (1) a CNN image classification model using TensorFlow, (2) a CNN U-Net model for pixel regression using TensorFlow, and (3) a CNN U-Net model for pixel regression using PyTorch.
